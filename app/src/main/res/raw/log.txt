TERM PROJECT LOG

NOTE: Steven Vegdahl's slapjack game and CS 301 game framework were used extensively to build and inspire different
    algorithms in the game.

ENTRY #1 (Weslyn Nishimura)
Date:
    November 14, 2017
Problem:
    Unknown how to randomly arrange the cards in an ArrayList for the shuffle() methods in the Deck
    class.
Source Used:
    Googled "shuffling a deck of card in java" and was brought to a geeksforgeeks.org page.
    http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/shuffle-a-deck-of-cards-3/
Solution:
    The source above discusses a method for shuffling cards using the Random class to generate a
    random number and setting that as the index for a given card. Continually doing this for all
    cards will randomly shuffle the whole deck. Another method suggested was to use the Collections
    class which can change the order of objects within the ArrayList.

ENTRY #2 (Weslyn Nishimura and Rhianna Pinkerton)
Date:
    December 4, 2017
Problem:
    Unable to toggle between different GUI Layouts for the Title Screen and the Game Configuration
    Screen.
Source Used:
    Rhianna and Weslyn when to see Dr. Vegdahl. Chelle Plaisted was also a resource.
Solution:
    Make multiple activities and call on the other activity when needed (Chelle implemented this
    into the code).

ENTRY #3 (Rhianna Pinkerton and Chelle Plaisted)
Date:
    December 6, 2017
Problem:
    Network play did not show up on remote player's tablet.

Solution:
    Deep copy the state and card elements.

ENTRY #4 (Alexa Ruiz)

Problem:
    Having a hard time figuring out correct placements of cards on screen.
Resource Used:
    https://developer.android.com/training/custom-views/custom-drawing.html
Solution:
    Able to read through the developer information and get a better grasp on how the rectangles should be drawing using percentages.

ENTRY #5 (Chelle Plaisted)
Date:
    12/7/17
Problem:
    Couldn't figure out how to correctly have the drop down top menu bring up a pop-up for the user manual.
Resource Used:
    CS 301 Hearts' team member Lindsay Lavee steered me towards an AlertDialogBuilder to complete the task.

    Was able to bring up the menu at any point during the game.

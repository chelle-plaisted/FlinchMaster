Entry #1
Date:
    November 14, 2017
Problem:
    Unknown how to randomly arrange the cards in an ArrayList for the shuffle() methods in the Deck
    class.
Source Used:
    Googled "shuffling a deck of card in java" and was brought to a geeksforgeeks.org page.
    http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/shuffle-a-deck-of-cards-3/
Solution:
    The source above discusses a method for shuffling cards using the Random class to generate a
    random number and setting that as the index for a given card. Continually doing this for all
    cards will randomly shuffle the whole deck.

Entry #1 (Weslyn Nishimura)
Date:
    November 14, 2017
Problem:
    Unknown how to randomly arrange the cards in an ArrayList for the shuffle() methods in the Deck
    class.
Source Used:
    Googled "shuffling a deck of card in java" and was brought to a geeksforgeeks.org page.
    http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/shuffle-a-deck-of-cards-3/
Solution:
    The source above discusses a method for shuffling cards using the Random class to generate a
    random number and setting that as the index for a given card. Continually doing this for all
    cards will randomly shuffle the whole deck. Another method suggested was to use the Collections
    class which can change the order of objects within the ArrayList.
